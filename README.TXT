Zendesk_Tungte_Lin.py is the Python application for the coding challenge of Software Engineering Intern at Zendesk.

The language I used was Python 3(3.9.0).
The libraries I used were json, math, requests and unittest.
All are built-in libraries. Users don't need to install another library.
Just install Python 3 and run this application, it will work.

There are 2 menus: the main menu and the page viewing menu.
The main menu can select the page viewing menu or run unit tests.
The page viewing menu can see a list of tickets(Choose a page number) or read the detail of one ticket (Press 'r' first then input the Ticket ID).
Users can exit by pressing '0' in both menus. 

I am able to finish more functions for this application, but the time was really not enough.
I only had 1 day to finish it.
Therefore, it is just a simple CLI application.
